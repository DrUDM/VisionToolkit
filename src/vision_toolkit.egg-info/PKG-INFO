# VisionToolkit

## Install

To install the `vision_toolkit` package which contains our library, run

```bash
python -m pip install .
```

## Notebooks

To run the notebooks, download the `documentation/demo/` folder.
The notebooks will be expanded and further detailed by January.

## Updates

Note that certain functions --- specifically `aoi_visualization`, `saliency_comparison`, `saccade_task` and `pursuit_task` --- are still under internal review and will be added by January.
Additionally, the RIM functionality is currently hosted in a separate Git repository due to its large size.



python setup.py build_ext --inplace
