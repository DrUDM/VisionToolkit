# VisionToolkit

## Install

To install the `vision_toolkit` package which contains our library, run

```bash
python -m pip install .
```

## Notebooks

To run the notebooks, download the `documentation/demo/` folder.

## Updates

Note that certain functions - specifically `aoi_visualization`, `saccade_task` and `pursuit_task` - are still under review and will be added by early December. 
Additionally, the RIM functionality is currently hosted in a separate Git repository due to its large size.
